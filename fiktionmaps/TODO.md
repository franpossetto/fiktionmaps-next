# Fiktionmaps TODOs

## Inbox

## Backlog

- [ ] Clean up place storage assets when deleting a fiction: add `deleteAssetsByFictionId` to `PlacesRepositoryPort` + Supabase impl; extend `deleteFictionUseCase` to call it before `fictionsRepo.delete` (DB `ON DELETE CASCADE` already removes `places` / `scenes` rows; Supabase Storage files for those places stay orphaned without this).

## In progress
